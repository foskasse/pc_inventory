# PC Inventory Management

This Python script allows you to manage PC inventory by loading data from CSV files into an SQLite database and providing a GUI interface to view the last 10 entries and search by serial number, memory serial, and board serial.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SQLite

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/foskasse/pc-inventory-management.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. If needed create an SQLite database:

   ```bash
   python CreateDatabase.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Load PC inventory data from a CSV file to the CSVToBeProcessed Folder (you can run it manually or crontab):

   ```bash
   python ETLDatabase.py.py
   ```

2. Run the GUI application:

   ```bash
   python Interface.py
   ```

3. Run the Web Interface (http://127.0.0.1:5000/):

   ```bash
   python Web.py
   ```
